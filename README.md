## NodeMCU Experiment

- **Setup:** Connect two NodeMCUs named server and client.
- **Data Transfer:** Send data from server to client.
- **Observations:** Study data rate drops in different environmental conditions and ranges.

## Raspberry Pi Experiments

- **Ad-hoc Network:** Set up one Raspberry Pi as an ad-hoc network and connect another Raspberry Pi.
- **Data Transfer:** Send large data (videos) and observe data rates in relation to range.
- **Observations:** Analyze data rates based on the varying conditions.

## WiFi Adapter Experiment

- **Setup:** Connect a WiFi adapter to a Raspberry Pi to extend the transmission range.
- **Data Transfer:** Send data with the extended range.
- **Observations:** Observe variations in data rates with increased distance.

## Potential Next Steps

1. **Analysis:** Analyze collected data to identify patterns and trends.
2. **Comparison:** Compare data rates between NodeMCUs and Raspberry Pis.
3. **Optimization:** Explore ways to optimize data rates.
4. **Documentation:** Document methodologies, results, and challenges faced.

## Conclusion

Summarize key insights, lessons learned, and areas for future improvement.
